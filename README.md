# Top Laner's Individual Performance to Win Analysis

An analysis of the critical factors for success in the top lane role of League of Legends esports.

## Introduction
League of Legends is an incredibly popular 5 v 5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game. This analysis will be done on one of the 5 positions in the game, the "Top Laner". The data I will be working with is from the 2022 esport season of League of Legends and has been developed by the Oracle's Elixer. This means all of the data is pro-player centered. 

A common sentiment among many Top Lane players is that their role does not matter or that it is very hard for a good Top Laner to consistently convert their skill to win a match. This is due to the fact that League of Legends is a team game with 5 players on each side. Top Laners face-off in the 'Top Lane' of the map which is very isolated from the rest of the 8 players on the map. 

The question that I want to answer is **Which stats of a Top laner are best suited to predicting a win?**

## Columns 

This data set of pro-player matches contains necessary post-game data combined with match wins and losses. This analysis will only be examining the stats of individual Top Lane players, meaning there are 2 rows of data per game as each team in a matchup will have a Top Laner. This results in the current Data Frame containing 21244 rows.
